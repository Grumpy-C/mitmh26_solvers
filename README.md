# mit mystery hunt 2026 solvers

various solvers i used within this puzzlehunt, this was mainly for the dichotomies mini-puzzles

my team (literally animal farm) ended up 8th

just wanted to post these solvers

## notes
i'm a bad programmer:
- i rushed making these
- did not employ the most efficent solution most the time, used searching algorithms instead of reversing logic
- you may see unused code
- swearing within the code (i got frustrated)
- used python

the solvers work atleast (to a degree)
